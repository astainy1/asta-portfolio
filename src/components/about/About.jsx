          I'm a self-taught tech enthusiast from Liberia with a strong passion
          for computers, coding, and cybersecurity. I started learning about
          technology on my own after high school and have gained real skills in
          web development, graphic design, and software troubleshooting.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
          Iâ€™ve worked on different kinds of projects; from building websites to
          helping people fix computer and phone issues. I love solving problems
          and learning new things every day. My goal is to become one of the top
          cybersecurity experts in Liberia and help others grow in tech as well.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
          Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, watching computer-related movies,
          and playing video games. I'm always open to new opportunities,
          collaborations, or just a friendly tech talk.
